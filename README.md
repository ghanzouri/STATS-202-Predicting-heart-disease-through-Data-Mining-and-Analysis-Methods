# STATS-202-Predicting-heart-disease-through-Data-Mining-and-Analysis-Methods

The project consists of analysis of a dataset designed to assess whether a new biological assay (feature assay) is predictive of heart disease (outcome Status).
The project will consist of :

• A Kaggle contest to develop a good predictive model of Status as a function of features in the model.

• A writeup describing the approach taken, how a particular model was chosen for the kaggle contest, etc.

This data set is derived from the South African Heart data set in Elements of Statistical Learning. Our goal is to predict the binary Status (a simulated response) from the other features, with particular interest in seeing if our new assay is predictive of disease or not.

This project has allowed us to compare different predictive models. 

We have implemented the following models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Boosting, Lasso, Ridge and Support Vector Machine. 

Our paper showcases that the best predictive model of the variable **Status** is Boosting on Kaggle and LASSO on the followup dataset (more info in the paper).
